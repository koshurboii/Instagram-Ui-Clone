# Instagram UI Clone

A simple web-based clone of Instagram's user interface, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the visual design and basic interactions of the Instagram app without backend functionality.

## Features

- **Splash Screen**: Animated logo display before redirecting to the main page
- **Home Feed**: Scrollable feed with posts, stories, and interactive elements
- **Stories**: Horizontal scrollable user stories with video playback
- **Search Page**: Instagram-like search interface with tabs for accounts, tags, and places
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (mobile and desktop)
- **Bottom Navigation**: Quick access to main sections
- **Interactive Elements**: Like animations, dropdown menus, and smooth scrolling

# Note:
- I created this project just for fun . The code works, but it’s not written in a production-level structure or for actual use 😅. 
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality and DOM manipulation

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. The app will automatically redirect to the home page after 2 seconds
4. Navigate using the bottom navigation or links
